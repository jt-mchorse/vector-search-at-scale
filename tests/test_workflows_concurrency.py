"""Lock that every workflow file has a top-level `concurrency:` group.

Companion to `test_workflows_yaml_parseable.py` and
`test_workflows_timeout_minutes.py` — same silent-rot prevention
arc, different failure mode.

The failure mode this catches: without a `concurrency:` group, a rapid
push-on-push (rebased session branch force-pushed, PR chain merged in
quick succession, contributor amending in flight) burns one full CI run
per push even though the in-flight run is immediately superseded. The
wasted runs eat operator quota and obscure which run is the "real"
check for a PR.

The lock matches the audit-side fingerprint shipped in portfolio-ops #41
(`audit_phase_a.py --check missing-concurrency`); each repo's per-repo
lock catches the regression at PR test time, the audit catches it after
the fact for direct-to-main commits and operator-disabled CI.

Spec / origin: this repo's #45. Propagated from llm-eval-harness #64.
