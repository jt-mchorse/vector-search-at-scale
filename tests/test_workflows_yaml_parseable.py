"""Lock that every workflow YAML in this repo parses cleanly.

Propagation of `portfolio-ops/tests/test_workflows_yaml_parseable.py` (issue
portfolio-ops#30 / PR portfolio-ops#31). The original lock was written
because PR portfolio-ops#27 / portfolio-ops#28 closed a 21-day silent CI
outage caused by a single unquoted colon-space in a `run:` value:

    - name: Verify D-001 baseline decision exists
      run: grep -q "id: D-001" MEMORY/core_decisions_ai.md

`yaml.safe_load()` rejected the line with
`ScannerError: mapping values are not allowed here`. GitHub Actions'
parser was lenient enough to *complete* the workflow run with zero jobs
and `conclusion=failure`. `statusCheckRollup` stayed empty so PR
auto-merge in Phase A couldn't tell that no CI ran.

`vector-search-at-scale`'s workflows use the `run: |` block-scalar
form today and are YAML-safe, so this lock is the inverse safety net:
it makes the unparseable-shape failure *cannot* land here either. A
`jobs:` non-empty assertion catches the broader "valid YAML, no actual
workflow" failure mode in case GitHub Actions silently absorbs another
shape the same way.

llm-eval-harness#60, this repo's #41.
