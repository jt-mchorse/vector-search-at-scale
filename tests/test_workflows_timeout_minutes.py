"""Lock that every workflow job has a sensible `timeout-minutes` bound.

Companion to `test_workflows_yaml_parseable.py` (this repo's #42, propagated
from portfolio-ops#30 / #31) — same silent-rot prevention arc, different
failure mode.

The failure mode this catches: GitHub Actions defaults to 360 minutes
(6 hours) per job when no `timeout-minutes` is set. A hung job — network
stall during `pip install`, stuck `terraform init` provider download,
`apt-get install` stall, infinite loop in a metric test — therefore
burns the full 6-hour ceiling before the runner kills it. That's quota
the operator pays for whether the run produced anything or not.

`llm-eval-harness` shipped the canonical first hop in PR #63. This file
is the propagation hop for `vector-search-at-scale` per issue #43. The
policy band [1, 30] matches llm-eval-harness's; per-job values land at
15 for `fmt`, `shellcheck`, `python`, and `memory-check`, and at 20 for
`validate` because `terraform init` across every module + env on a cold
provider cache is the longest-running job and deserves wider headroom.
When the 1M/10M/100M benchmark suites from §2 of the portfolio handoff
actually land in this repo, `MAX_TIMEOUT_MINUTES` should bump and a
per-job comment should name the workload that forced the change.

Spec / origin: this repo's #43.
